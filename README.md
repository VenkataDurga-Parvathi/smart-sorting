Transfer Learning for Identifying Rotten Fruits and Vegetables
📌 Project Overview
Smart Sorting is a Deep Learning based web application that classifies fruits and vegetables as Fresh or Rotten using Transfer Learning.
The system is built using:
🧠 TensorFlow & Keras
📷 MobileNetV2 (Pre-trained CNN)
🌐 Flask Web Framework
🎨 HTML, CSS
💻 VS Code
The model is trained on labeled fruit images and integrated into a Flask web application where users can upload an image and receive an instant prediction with confidence score.
